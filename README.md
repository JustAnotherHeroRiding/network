# This is project 4 for CS50web. 

My goal is for this to be my first React project where I handle all the logic on the Front-End without any page refreshes and loading different html files but instead using Django only for the api in the background which will be used for fetching data.

Currently it is still missing the last 2 requirements, which are Editing posts and Liking and Unliking.
